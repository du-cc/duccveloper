<h1>My story</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I started to touch coding when I was 11. Because of a video from YouTube about batch virus (idk I have the link or not). So I downloaded it, ran it, love it, so I open notepad and started explored inside of this piece of thing. And I found out that if you edit some strings inside the scripts, it can change the whole text it will display. So I started <b>overcustomizing</b> and it worked like a charm! So I watched some YouTube videos and made my <b>FIRST EVER PROJECT</b> the MEMZ virus <a href="https://www.github.com/duccveloper/MEMZ">it's still archived by me</a>, it's a piece of mess. But that's my childhood...</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>So, I started to learn batch stuff, (from stackoverflow 100%) and some of logics stuff like if, else etc.. Until I mastered the language (not really). So I started learning HTML, CSS, JS and Lua. I learned website set first, because in my country (past) it have a computer class and then it teached you ONLY ONE tag, it's <code>&lt;marquee></code> so if you run my old MEMZ, you can see too many marquees rollin over when payload. And then I learned something from StackOverflow and w3schools, I started to make a website from scratch, it looks horrible! (I don't know how to center a div lol)

<p>I think I will move my story in my website when it's done</p>
